## Microcraft E1. <small>_Init Window. OpenGL Seutup._</small>

Hello everyone. I am so glad can have the qualification can engage to the 
Microcraft Development Series.

In this series, we'll gonna to trying implementing the Basic Technology 
Aspect of Minecraft.

Obviously, no one wants to cause the possible of offense, I am genuine
attitude. Minecraft Classic is kind of Decent, almost no one can get the 
height of its even 1% in some aspect for actually even no one need to say
but people knows it who really understand 1% of mc or little bit more.

However, we're really gotta go, so lets begin.

## 1. New Directory of the Project

It's simple, but not trivial. I'd like to create the directory by my self 
manually instead of create it by IDE.

I don't want overstated, but something, the project, needed to be tight,
not pile of crap which loosen mess, but have a well control.

```
$ mkdir ~/YouResponsitory/Microcraft
```

Then just use CLion, open the empty directory.

> Why use CLion, actually it's not a big deal. the Visual Studio is terrible tho it's little cool. VSCode is horrible since it's based on something web browser. 

ok all fine, we just got autogenerated .idea dir, but no one cares.


### 2. GLFW Init

It's time to setup the Window.

### 4. GLAD Init.

GLAD is helping for us to use OpenGL properly.
